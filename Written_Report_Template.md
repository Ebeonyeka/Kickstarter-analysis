# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns: 

## Overview of Project: The project is to help a new playwriter, Louise, start a crowdfunding campaign for her new play called Fever. She has a budget of over $10,000 for advertising, costumes etc. and reached out for help on how to maximize value. The historic crowdfunding data from Kickstarter fundraising platform over a nine-year period was analysed for trends or specific factors that influence or drive a successful campaign and to advise Louise accordingly.

### Purpose: Trend analysis for insights to inform recommendations and decision making.

## Analysis and Challenges:Started the analysis by cleaning up the data from Kickstarter crowdfunding platform for over 4000 projects and making it more readable using Excel tools. I looked at the different categories and subcategories of outcomes in the United States (US) and Great Britain (GB) (since Louise is interested in Great Britain for a future project) to identify the top performers, “theaters” was found to be the most successful category in the two countries while “Plays” was the most successful subcategory over the past nine years which is good news considering Louise’s objective. Due to fast changing consumer behaviours in today’s world, a further analysis of data from the most recent years (2016 & 2017) was done and it confirmed “Plays” was still the most successful with over 61% success rate. 

Analysing the outcomes based on goals show that the lower budget plays were more successful at raising required pledges as Plays with less than $4,999 goal had average success rate of 74%. Bearing in mind, Louise’s budget, Plays with goals ranging between $10000 to $14999 had 54% success rate. 
Analysing the data based on campaign launch date shows that the most successful months for Theater are May and June. However, looking at 2016 & 2017 data showed that the most successful months were January to May.
Challenges: encountered errors (#DIV/0!) when creating “Average Donation” column. The timeline for the project wasn’t given which makes it difficult draw conclusions from 2009-2017 data.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:a.The most successful Kickstarter campaigns ran in May & June over the nine-year period under review. However, the range changed in 2016 – 2017 to January to May which should influence decision making considering that it represents more recent information. The months also had similar cancellation rates except for April with significantly lower Plays and cancellations. 

b.The length of campaign doesn’t appear correlated with its success. This is based on average run days of 34 for failed Plays and 28 for successful Plays.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: a.The mean campaign goal for Plays is around $5,000 and campaigns below this mean had average success rate of 74% while the success rate of goals ranging between $10000 to $14,999 was 54%. Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than $5,000. 
b.The average donation from successful Plays is about $94 therefore Louise should target minimum 54 backers if she’s able to produce her play at the recommended amount.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? given above

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? given above

- What are some limitations of this dataset? a.	The dataset is considered outdated. The Covid-19 pandemic has totally changed consumer behaviours and disposable income hence sole reliance on this data might lead to misleading conclusions.  
b.	The country information is good and insightful but vague. The United States has five prominent geographical regions with varying characteristics and taste. A campaign can be successful in the West but fail in the Northeast. Specific location of the campaigns would have been more helpful information for decision making.  
c.	Possible reasons for the failed campaigns would be very insightful if included in the dataset.
d.	The blurb should have been detailed enough to show the specific type of Plays (is it comedy, tragedy etc). One of blurbs just had “Help us raise the funds to film our pilot episode!” even though the Play was successful, a campaign should have more information to attract backers and to give additional insight to make informed decisions. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
a.	Creating a column for the length of fundraising campaigns. 
b.	Creating a graph to review most recent 2-3 years of data
